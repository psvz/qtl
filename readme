Quasar Take Load tool

Usage: ./qtl <block_device_name_from_/proc/diskstats>

The tool prints out consistent 1-second load samples and targeted for using with HTTP-query stress-array (quasar).

Printed statistics:

[%,  Load]
First number is the instant load from /proc/loadavg expressed as percentage of available CPU cores. 100% means
that instant number of processes in R state (running+runnable) equals to the number of CPU cores. Note, that
D state is not counted here as <man proc> would suggest. The second number (after /) is the total number of
scheduling entities on the system.

[kBread]
Number of kilobytes read from the block_device (taken from /proc/diskstats) during the second represented. The
bytes in question are physically transferred bytes (from the device driver to kernel buffers).

[kBwritten]
Same as kBread but opposite direction.

[%timeReading]
Percentage of time spent in the device driver reading (as relation to the real time). This reflects parallelism
of the operations and may get to thousands.

[%timeWriting]
Same as %timeReading but for writing.

[%CPUtimeIO]
This is /proc/stat indicator of CPU time spent in I/O (threads' D state) related to the number of CPU cores and
real time elapsed, expressed per cent. 100% here means that all CPU cycles are consumed for moving data to-and-
from block devices (not the only one given as the argument to the tool). 100% would be practically unreachable.

The print-out interval of 1 second may be changed at compile time (PERIOD definition) which might be dubious idea.
